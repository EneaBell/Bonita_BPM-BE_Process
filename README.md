In the import wizard, select *Bonita 6.x and 7.x* and the .bos file from the repository.
### Publish ESOA organization on the server
To run the process, we need to publish the imported organization. As is, the users in the organization login are: 
•	be
•	acd
•	blg
With password *ESOA*.

## Run Process
If you are in the Bonita BPM IDE, you can deploy and run the process by clicking on the Run button in the toolbar.
Otherwise, you can run the process directly from the server.
### From the server
Log in the portal and change to the administrator view on the top right. Go in *BPM ->  Processes* and click on + Install button. Select the .bar file from the repository.
